\usage{
plotCatchAtAge(prediction, unit = "millions", plusGroup = NULL,
  credibility = 0.95, title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{prediction}{as returned by \code{\link[Reca]{eca.predict}} or \code{\link[prepRECA]{runRECA}}.}

\item{unit}{unit of reported estimates. See details.}

\item{plusGroup}{Fish this age or older will be grouped in plot}

\description{
Plots estimated total catch at age for each age group.
 Constructs equal tailed credibility intervals (The probability mass above and below the interval is approximatelty the same).
